# Budget-App

Budget App is a console application (hopefully to be a form application in a later time) that will allow users to track monthly expenses. It is being developed using the C# coding language and will utilize DBeaver for database storage.  The user will be able to see a description of the expense, the expense amount, and the due date. The user will also have the ability to add, update, and delete expenses.
